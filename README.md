This collection of projects is intended to showcase the skills gained by taking CSCI5523 - Intro to Data Mining at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. It will NOT include all coursework, and all code is uploaded AFTER its due date.

All works are solely to be viewed by employers, colleagues, or simply the curious. It is not permitted to use my work for future offerings of 5523. Review UMN policies on academic dishonesty for more information
