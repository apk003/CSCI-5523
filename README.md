This collection of projects is intended to showcase the skills gained by taking CSCI 5523 - Intro to Data Mining at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. It will NOT include all coursework, and all code is uploaded AFTER its due date.

For those unfamiliar with the course, each homework is an implementation of some data mining algorithm using PySpark for MapReduce. Some of these include: PCY and SON algorithm for finding association rules, locality-sensitive minhash shingling for determining item similarity, and more!

All works are solely to be viewed by employers, colleagues, or simply the curious. It is not permitted to use my work for future offerings of 5523. Review UMN policies on academic dishonesty for more information
